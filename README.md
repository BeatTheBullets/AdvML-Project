# File explanation 

> This is an explanation of files for the final submission of the course project in (FTE40306)Advanced Machine Learning, by Jialin He and George Truijens.

It is important to keep the structure of this folder so that the notebooks can read data from the `data` folder correctly. If you just upload the notebooks to Colab, you need to manually upload the `data` folder as well.



In folder `fig` , you find all the figures used in the report.

In folder `data/crop_features`, you find all the data used for training and the data extracted with autoencoders. 

With `active_learning_project_2024.ipynb`, you can see the main program of the project.

With `AutoEncoder_feature_extractor_xxxd.ipynb`, you can extract data of different dimensions with autoencoders from the original images.

With `active_learning_project_2024_auto_encoders.ipynb` , you can get the results for active learning applied on the extracted data from autoencoders.

Enjoy Machine Learning, enjoy coding and enjoy life! :smile:
