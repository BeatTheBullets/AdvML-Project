# File explanation 

> This is an explanation of files for the course project in (FTE40306)Advanced Machine Learning, made in collaboration with Jialin He.

It is important to keep the structure of this folder so that the notebooks can read data from the `data` folder correctly (folder not included). 

With `active_learning_project_2024.ipynb`, you can see the main program of the project.

With `AutoEncoder_feature_extractor_xxxd.ipynb`, you can extract data of different dimensions with autoencoders from the original images.

With `active_learning_project_2024_auto_encoders.ipynb` , you can get the results for active learning applied on the extracted data from autoencoders.

Enjoy Machine Learning, enjoy coding and enjoy life! :smile:
